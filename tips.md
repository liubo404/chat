chatgpt已经不行了，我来告诉你一个奇技淫巧。
第一步，创建一个txt或者markdown
读论文：打开论文，打开newbing，不懂就问，笔记记在刚才创建的文档里。无论读多少篇，看多少博客，什么都别管，全记在文档里，不用分类打tag乱七八糟的。
提炼/总结/查找知识点：将大杂烩文章上传到github，打开newbing。好了，你可以问newbing任何基于你笔记的问题了。
用这样的方法，你甚至可以丢一大堆论文到txt里，让newbing帮你写一个组会用的slides。

My first question is:

Tom credited the patriotic spirit of the nation for avoiding bloodshed over the weekend.

What's the meaning of "credited" here?

The word “credited” in this sentence is a verb that means “to consider usually favorably as the source, agent, or performer of an action or the possessor of a trait”.1

In other words, Tom thinks that the patriotic spirit of the nation is the reason or the cause for avoiding bloodshed over the weekend. He acknowledges or recognizes the patriotic spirit as a positive factor.

Here is another example of using “credited” in a similar way:

She credited her success to hard work and perseverance.

This means that she thinks that hard work and perseverance are the reasons or the causes for her success. She acknowledges or recognizes hard work and perseverance as positive factors.

I hope this helps you understand the meaning of “credited”. Do you have any other questions?
