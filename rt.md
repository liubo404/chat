# China rejects Pentagon meeting request
The US has been trying to arrange a face-to-face conversation between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu

China has rejected Washington’s proposal that their respective defense chiefs meet this week, the Pentagon said on Monday. The news comes amid a renewed diplomatic spat between the two countries. 

“Overnight, the PRC informed the US that they have declined our early May invitation for Secretary [Lloyd] Austin to meet with PRC Minister of National Defense Li Shangfu in Singapore,” the Pentagon said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, referring to the People’s Republic of China. 

“The Department believes strongly in the importance of maintaining open lines of military-to-military communication between Washington and Beijing to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict,” the statement read.

The WSJ cited an unnamed US defense official as saying that China’s dismissal was “an unusually blunt message.” 

According to the report, the Pentagon had wanted the meeting to take place on the sidelines of the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum. Li will speak at the event as part of his trip to Singapore from May 31 to June 4, the Chinese Defense Ministry said. 

The Pentagon said last week that attempts to establish contacts with their Chinese counterparts in recent months have failed. 

The Financial Times reported this month that Beijing told Washington that there was “little chance” for a meeting between Li and Austin because of the sanctions placed on the Chinese defense minister over his alleged role in the purchase of Russian weapons. Li was appointed to his current position in March, replacing Wei Fenghe.

Last week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry cast doubt on the sincerity of Washington’s willingness to engage in dialogue while simultaneously “seeking to suppress China through all possible means” and imposing restrictions on Chinese officials and entities. 

At a summit in Hiroshima, Japan earlier this month, the G7 released a joint statement with a litany of accusations against China, including “economic coercion,” human rights abuses, and the inciting of tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing accused the US-led group of countries of trying to impose their will on others and meddling in China’s domestic affairs.

# Kosovo PM dreams of becoming new Zelensky – Vucic
Albin Kurti’s approach may result in “big conflicts” in the breakaway province, the Serbian president has said

Tensions in Serbia’s breakaway province of Kosovo may spiral out of control because of the actions of its prime minister, Albin Kurti, warned Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic in an interview released on Sunday amid violent clashes between local police and Serb protesters.

Speaking to the Serbian TV channel Pink, Vucic said that “the most difficult situation in Kosovo and Metohija is yet to follow. Something we have not seen until now, all thanks to the provocative actions and terribly irresponsible behavior of Albin Kurti.” 

The Serbian leader went on to say that he was “afraid of general insecurity, instability” and of “big conflicts” in the breakaway province.

“I know that this other one [Kurti], who caused everything, doesn’t want to retire for a living, because he longs and dreams of being a [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky,” he added.

Vucic noted that he had been contacted by several European envoys who voiced concern over the ongoing situation in Kosovo, which has been marked by violent clashes between local police and ethnic Serbs, who make up the majority in the northern part of the region.

In one of the municipalities law enforcement officers fired tear gas to disperse protesters who had tried to prevent a newly elected ethnic-Albanian mayor from entering his office, resulting in several injuries.

The unrest came after local Serbs mostly boycotted elections in four northern municipalities, which saw a total turnout of just 3.47%, arguing that they would not work with new mayors from ethnic Albanian parties who do not represent their interests.

Amid the clashes, Serbia placed its army on high alert, moving some units closer to the region’s border. Defense Minister Milos Vucevic said that “it is clear that terror against the Serb community in Kosovo is happening.” 

Meanwhile, a number of Western countries, including the US, France, Italy, Germany, and Britain, issued an unexpectedly harsh public rebuke of Kosovo, condemning the use of force and calling on the local authorities “to immediately step back and de-escalate.” 

Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in 2008 with the support of the US and many of its allies. The breakaway region is not recognized by several countries, including Russia, China, and Serbia itself.

# Kosovo has ‘crossed the Rubicon’ – Serbia
Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s latest crackdown threatens open war, Belgrade has said

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused the ethnic Albanian government in Pristina of trying to provoke a war on Wednesday, after the breakaway province closed the border to all Serbian vehicles and arrested several prominent Serbs.

Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti ordered the closure of the border after three Kosovo police officers were detained by Serbian security forces on Tuesday morning. He has said that the blockade will remain in effect until the three men are released. 

Kurti claimed the trio was “abducted” inside Kosovo in “open acts of international aggression” by Serbia. Vucic has said they were on the other side of the line of control and that he had proof.

“They were arrested 1.8km from the administrative line,” Vucic told the state broadcaster RTS on Wednesday evening. “That’s pretty far from the place where they left their car. Kurti says they were 300 meters from the line. What were they doing 300 meters from the line, without telling KFOR?” he added, referring to the NATO peacekeeping mission. 

The blockade is an attempt to starve the Serbs in the north of Kosovo and force them out of their homes, Vucic argued.

Kurti “wants to start a war at all costs,” the Serbian president added. “The Rubicon has been crossed and it will be hard to get back to normal.”

Vucic also objected to Tuesday’s arrests of two prominent Serbs, whom the ethnic Albanian government accused of organizing an “attack” on NATO peacekeepers last month. He claimed that the EU and NATO had given him guarantees there would be no arrests but had done nothing to stop Kurti.

EU foreign policy commissioner Josep Borrell also sent a letter to Kurti on Wednesday urging him to “de-escalate” the situation. In what amounted to unusually strong language from Brussels, Borrell wrote that Pristina needs to “take the opinions of EULEX and KFOR fully into account and treat them as partners, which also means coordinating with them in advance,” which was not the case on Tuesday. EULEX is the European bloc’s civilian mission tasked with monitoring Kosovo. 

“As 27 EU Member States have made it very clear, failure to de-escalate will result in negative consequences,” Borrell warned. 

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has already canceled a meeting with Kurti scheduled for Wednesday, saying it could not be held due to the “hourly worsening of Kosovo’s relations with the entire Euro-Atlantic community.”

Kurti’s crackdown has gone beyond just the Serbs, however. His government has also revoked the license of the privately owned TV outlet ‘Klan Kosova’, which the head of the Association of Journalists of Kosovo described as “an unprecedented act aimed against media freedoms.”

Ramush Haradinaj, a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and leader of the AAK opposition party, was quoted by local media on Wednesday as saying that Kurti was “threatening Kosovo’s alliance with the US and NATO” and called for a no-confidence vote against the prime minister.

NATO deployed troops in Kosovo in 1999, after a 78-day bombing campaign against Serbia. Belgrade has refused to recognize Pristina’s 2008 declaration of independence.

# NATO must urgently protect Kosovo Serbs – Belgrade
Serbia’s top general says the army is ready to act if the order is given
 
Serbs in Kosovo are under attack by the ethnic Albanian government in Pristina and NATO’s KFOR peacekeepers have a duty to stop it, General Milan Mojsilovic, the head of the Serbian General Staff, said on Friday.

“The Pristina regime of [PM] Albin Kurti is carrying out a horrible pogrom against the Serbian people in Kosovo-Metohija. Serbs are targeted every day, solely because of their names, and because they do not want to leave their ancestral homes. The terror of Kurti’s regime is becoming physically unbearable,” Mojsilovic said in a brief televised address.

Belgrade is “following the events with great concern, and demands urgent measures to protect the Serbs and their right to exist,” he added.

Asking KFOR and all other international institutions in the breakaway province to act, Mojsilovic noted that Serbia has carried out all of its obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, the Kumanovo military-technical agreement, and others, “but it is clear today that the international community has not fulfilled theirs.”

If ordered, the Serbian Army will “carry out its mission to the fullest,” in accordance with the constitution and the UN Charter, Mojsilovic said, ending the two-minute address without taking questions.

Serbia’s top general met with President Aleksandar Vucic earlier in the day, following the violent arrest of yet another Serb in the north of Kosovo and the appearance of videos on social media showing heavily armed ethnic Albanian troops deploying near the town of Kosovska Mitrovica.

Kurti’s government has detained more than a dozen ethnic Serbs in recent weeks. Pristina has presented the arrests as enforcing the ‘rule of law’ on the entire territory of Kosovo. Belgrade has described them as a ‘hybrid war’ intended to intimidate the local community and condoned by the West.

Meanwhile, the US and EU have demanded the unconditional release of three ethnic Albanian ‘special police’ who were detained on the Serbian side of the administrative line last week.

NATO took control of Kosovo in 1999, after waging a 78-day air war against Serbia on behalf of ethnic Albanian separatists. Though UNSCR 1244 affirmed Serbia’s territorial integrity, the provisional government in Pristina declared independence in 2008. Belgrade’s refusal to recognize the secession has been supported by about half of the world’s countries, including Russia, China, and India.
