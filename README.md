## Group 2. Adjectives describing the degree of certainty
definitive: Something that is definitive provides a firm conclusion that cannot be questioned.
liable: When something is liable to happen, it is very likely to happen.
tentative: Tentative agreements, plans, or arrangements are not definite or certain but have been made as a first step.
