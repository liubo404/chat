### Hong Kong offers escape route for crypto exchanges
#### The proposal comes as many countries ratchet up their scrutiny of the crypto industry

Cryptocurrency exchanges, which have recently come under intense scrutiny globally, could gain broad support in Hong Kong, a member of the Chinese territory’s Legislative Council wrote on Saturday in a Twitter post.

Johnny Ng invited Coinbase and other crypto exchanges to establish operations in Hong Kong, and even hinted at potential stock listing opportunities.

“I hereby offer an invitation to welcome all global virtual asset trading operators including Coinbase to come to HK for application of official trading platforms and further development plans,” the legislator wrote. “Please feel free to approach me and I am happy to provide any assistance.”

The proposal came days after lawsuits were filed against two major cryptocurrency exchanges – Binance and Coinbase – by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The crackdown is the latest in a wave of drastic steps by the SEC, which has levied fines and other penalties against crypto-lending firms, following the collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, in November last year.

The region’s authorities have since come up with new regulations and compliance measures to encourage a major expansion of the cryptocurrency industry.

I often use the following traffic example to demonstrate the contrasting capabilities of the human brain and AI. Two cars are approaching a narrow choke point in opposite directions. There is heavy rain and wind outside. Car A is travelling twice as fast as Car B, but the distance to the choke point is twice as long for the former. Both drivers realise that, under normal conditions, Car B should speed up to exit the narrow strip. However, there is a large puddle of water in front of Car B, hinting at a risky pothole underneath. Both drivers instinctively realise that it is then better for Car A to exit the choke point first and thereby free up space in the adjoining lane for Car B to avoid the puddle. This is called situational awareness. The brain negotiates complexities like these without breaking the proverbial sweat – second after second!

### Despite the hype, artificial intelligence remains inferior to the human brain
#### With new alarming predictions being made every week, it is important to explore the limitations of AI. The human brain provides the best reference point

The global infoscape is currently abuzz with alarmist predictions over the dangers posed by artificial intelligence (AI). Billionaire entrepreneurs and their hirelings, who had once gushed over the emerging AI “technopia”, have suddenly turned apocalyptic. As the narrative du jour goes, a sentient AI may ultimately turn against its creators.

But are there any merits to this claim, apart from fictional cues from the Terminator franchise?

One way to answer that question would be to compare AI to an analogue that is already available and sentient, namely – the human brain. AI was designed not only to mimic the human mind but also to out-compute it in certain aspects. Apart from presenting a paradigm shift, AI’s utility is not entirely revolutionary. Rather, it is a continuation of innovations past and present – wheels, cranks, and windmills to surmount our limbic limitations; bows, arrows and missiles to counter remote threats; and the Internet to resolve space-time constraints in (global) communications. 

According to a notable article in the Foglets, “it is postulated that the human brain operates at 1 exaFLOP, which is equivalent to a billion calculations per second”. Mind you, this is just a postulation – a guesstimate likely defined by computing metrics. At the time of writing, Frontier, the world’s fastest supercomputer, reportedly operates at a speed of 1.102 exaFLOP. The difference between the brain and the supercomputer, however, lies in nature and function: one thinks while the other analyses data. 

AI ‘extinction’ should be same priority as nuclear war – experts

We have invented supercomputers to crunch numbers, but our scientists remain baffled by the neural processing prowess of human calculators. Shakuntala Devi, who grew up in a circus environment, was one prime example. Our sophisticated machine-mediated models still cannot fully comprehend how the brain works, beyond the fact that there is an atypical increase in blood flow to particular cerebral lobes when computational tasks are performed. The rest is a plane of scattered studies, suppositions, and data that have yet to be reconciled into a comprehensible whole.

There are too many unknowns with regards to the human brain. This may be the reason why the scientific community casually divides its major functions into eight or 12 primary categories. Where sentience lies within these categories remains an open question. Maybe, it is the result of cumulative interactions between all of them. Or maybe, humans have a sentient soul that makes them innovate in a way inaccessible to other species? Maybe, unlike AI devices and algorithms, the brain is software and hardware rolled into one? Too much uncertainty remains.

If neuroscience is an inchoate field riddled with myriad questions and gaps, what of its simpler subset – artificial intelligence? Can an embryonic technology invented by humans suddenly spring to life and threaten mankind? If we cannot fully understand how the human brain works or even define sentience, why are we cutting and pasting plots from sci-fi flicks onto our reality? 

There is a hypothetical chance that artificial intelligence does pose a real threat within a narrow spectrum. Poor software designs, rushed developmental processes and mismatched updates to algorithms, among others, can lead to various disaster scenarios. Those involve incidents at chemical or nuclear plants, on the stock market, or with experimental self-driving vehicles. But the prospect of an ominous, sentient AI is an imaginary proposition altogether.

The current fad in AI alarmism may actually be rooted in something more venal and down-to-earth. For it may not be machines that will ultimately revolt against its masters, but rather the hundreds of millions of workers – perhaps billions – who will be displaced by AI before this decade is out. This topic deserves a dedicated commentary on its own, and the human brain provides a reality check to the supposed existential threats posed by AI. 

Wonders of the human brain 
The nm.org resource provides the following snippet on our thinking organ and its processing capabilities: A fragment of brain tissue the size of a grain of sand contains 100,000 neurons and 1 billion synapses. The brain can generate about 23 watts of power – enough to power a light bulb. Information travels up to an impressive 268 miles per hour, while its storage capacity is considered virtually unlimited. Research suggests the human brain consists of about 86 billion neurons. Each neuron forms connections to other neurons, which could add up to 1 quadrillion (1,000 trillion) connections.

No wonder the Psalmist exulted in the fact that he was “fearfully and wonderfully made” in “his mother’s womb”. At any one second, the brain coordinates a bewildering variety of functions within itself and the human body in order to maintain organic harmony. It also rapidly compensates any deviation from the norm within the body in the event of a disruption i.e. shifting balance to one leg after another is impaired or activating hemostasis upon bleeding. The human body is therefore the ultimate complex adaptive system (CAS). 

While the body’s CAS functions are too vast and technical to be enumerated here, there are some worldly examples on how the brain contrives to protect its host. When you have a “pain in the neck” in a vexatious social setting, that is your brain sending an instruction via your body to seek the nearest exit, thereby avoiding a more serious condition. When you are suffering from snowballing intellectual torpor or depression, that may be the brain’s way of warning you to avoid fake news and the fools who peddle them. 

Traffic Test: Human brain vs AI 
While the brain generates 23 watts of power, the Frontier supercomputer consumes a whopping 21 megawatts (MW). One megawatt is one million watts. The energy factor alone is a reason why scientists are betting on biological computing as the next great technological frontier. Until then, we need to put up with hardware and software that still cannot match the human brain in relatively simple situations.

This is called situational awareness. The brain negotiates complexities like these without breaking the proverbial sweat – second after second!

Now, replace the drivers with autonomous driving systems and imagine the amount of energy and the scale of technological infrastructure needed to perform a similar task? The cars would need GPS navigation and weather updates, satellite and 5G connectivity, and a host of sensors. Satellite navigation may fail during a storm. So what should these ‘intelligent’ vehicles do? Stay put and halt traffic? Or seek a curb that is rapidly becoming muddy? Our human tactile senses would know when to accelerate out of a slippery situation, but self-driving cars would need a staggering array of hardware and algorithms to cope.

Now, imagine a billion cars operated by autonomous driving systems. How will the energy and computing power for this infrastructure be generated? Would a proverbial Death Star suffice, albeit for our collective benefit? 

Maybe, this is the conundrum that keeps AI alarmists awake at night? The AI technopia they envisage cannot support a global population of one billion, let alone the eight billion we have at present. 

In fact, according to the celebrated techno-prophet Yuval Noah Harari, the “big political and economic question of the 21st century will be what do we need humans for, or at least what do we need so many humans for”.

Now, if that doesn’t send an existential chill down your spine, I don’t know what will.


### EU fears fatigue over Ukrainian refugees
With inflation strangling the bloc’s economies, Brussels is concerned that the welcome shown to arrivals is wearing thin

The EU is experiencing “solidarity fatigue” towards Ukrainian refugees, the European Commission has warned in a report. The outflow of cash from bloc member governments to refugees is causing resentment, according to the research.

Despite the “unprecedented outpouring of solidarity” shown by EU citizens to Ukrainian refugees, “what we might call ‘solidarity fatigue’ is beginning to set in in some member states,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told a press conference on Tuesday.

In the report, special EU adviser on Ukraine Lodewijk Asscher notes that “the cost of living crisis has hit low- and medium-income families in host societies,” which are already struggling to integrate the roughly four million Ukrainian refugees in their care. Of this number, only 1.3 million are in any kind of employment, EU Jobs and Social Rights Commissioner Nicolas Schmit told EuroNews.

Those capable of work and seeking employment are often forced into competition with EU citizens, of whom more than 27 million are currently unemployed or underemployed. Likewise with accommodation – governments struggling to house their own people are now expected to house tens of thousands of new arrivals from Ukraine. 

Ireland, for example, has been gripped by one of the most acute housing shortages in the world for much of the last decade, yet has taken in more than 76,000 Ukrainian refugees, according to EU data. By contrast, France has taken in just under 70,000 Ukrainians, despite having a population 13 times that of Ireland and far more dwellings available per capita.

Aascher claimed that resentment among low- and middle-income Europeans has “created a context in which Russian propaganda could be more successful.” Neither Aascher nor Johannson suggested slowing the intake of refugees to appease their fatigued citizens, however, with both seemingly more concerned about the prospect of the public starting to side with Russia.

“The discourse of migration and refugees can be weaponized to sow division within the EU,” Johansson told reporters on Tuesday.

Johansson has long been an advocate for increased migration into the EU. Speaking in Brussels in 2020, she declared that the EU is “an ageing society,” and that Middle Eastern and African immigrants “should be welcomed, and should be part of our society,” despite the “risk of pushbacks” from native Europeans.

### Xi Jinping’s ‘worst-case scenario’ warning is realism, not pessimism
Locking horns with the US, China has been told to prepare for the most ‘extreme’ developments, but in this warning lies hope

Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned the country’s National Security Commission in stark terms of the grave security concerns facing the nation.

According to Xi, Beijing needs to stay “keenly aware” of the challenges facing national security and correctly grasp major related issues. He urged officials to be ready for “worst-case and most extreme scenarios” – words that a lot of commentators have described as “pessimistic” in regard to the development of relations between China and the United States.

This is not pessimism, however – rather, it’s a realistic perspective. The primary reason is that Beijing faces an extraordinarily ruthless adversary and most keen observers of the US are well aware of this. The phrase “worst-case scenarios,” when applied to a confrontation between China and the US, evokes apocalyptic images akin to the famous video game series Fallout – set to become a TV series this year. In fact, some of its wilder aspects aside, this 25-year-old franchise may offer a valuable perspective on the current situation.

The game is set in a wasteland following a terminal nuclear conflict primarily between the US and China. While it is never stated who started the fictional “Great War,” the president of what remains of the “official” United States who also happens to be one of the primary antagonists – says outright that China dropped the first bombs. However, it is apparent that this character has every reason to lie to the player. It’s also heavily implied that the US government is essentially the most evil organization in human history, committing almost every crime imaginable up to and including attempted genocide on a global scale, creating concentration camps for people of Chinese descent and fully capable of destroying organized human life purely on ideological grounds.

It is evident that the writers, who started the franchise in the late 1990s, felt America’s anti-communism would inevitably foist it against China in the not-so-distant future. But the ambiguity of who dropped the bombs also speaks to one of its greatest themes, which is that it doesn’t matter who did it because everyone loses in the end. The use of nuclear weapons is an indictment on humanity as a whole and not one particular individual or group.

Unfortunately, this foresight created a striking parallel to our current world. And that means that one of the most popular fiction franchises around today agrees with the point of President Xi: the US is not a good or stable actor and will, if given the opportunity, destroy or otherwise destabilize China (and the world by extension). The US has left so many bodies in its wake that a failure of the Chinese president to recognize this when dealing with Washington would be an actual disservice to his citizens.

As an example, China’s foreign ministry has estimated that between the end of World War II and 2001, there were 248 armed conflicts in 153 regions worldwide. Of these, 201 were initiated by the US. That is a staggering figure that demonstrates just how much of a threat Washington is to global peace and stability. Then factor in the litany of heinous acts it has committed or is committing around the world: Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and the list goes on.

Not only does the US bring death and destruction all over the world, it does it while imposing its hegemony to shackle entire nations under its dominion, leaving them purposefully underdeveloped while ruthlessly exploiting them. The fact, for instance, that the US is currently sanctioning China’s defense minister but is gaslighting Beijing about a lack of dialogue with him is the pinnacle of the disconnect between how Washington portrays itself and reality.

With Xi’s guidance, however, Beijing is pursuing a long-game strategy that avoids military conflict with Washington while focusing on China’s development. This is extraordinarily prudent, not only because it decreases the chance of nuclear conflict but also because it is accompanied by lifting millions of people around the world from poverty. This course would be challenging to plot if he did not have a realistic assessment of the US, but he does. He understands that time is on China’s side, unlike the US, which is rapidly decaying in virtually every aspect except its propensity for violence.

In contrast to the many post-apocalyptic works of science fiction, terminal conflict does not have to be inevitable. Nuclear arms are not necessarily one of Chekhov’s proverbial guns. There is no law of physics that dictates that the world must be sacrificed at the altar of any particular ideology. President Xi’s assessment of the US and his prescriptions for action are rooted firmly in this universal ideal of hope, which implies that there is some element of optimism to his motivations.

Rail safety improving?
Indian Railways, which carry millions of people across the country each year, have substantially improved their safety record in recent years, according to a 2021 press release by the Ministry of Railways. As Vaishnaw told the Lok Sabha – the lower house of India’s parliament – at that time, the number of train accidents in the country had shown an appreciable decline, from 104 “consequential train accidents” in 2016-17, to 22 in 2020-21. For two consecutive years, from 2019-20 to 2020-21, no loss of life was reported. In contrast, in 2016-17, 195 people lost their lives in train accidents.

### Trump pledges to use US military against drug cartels – Fox
The presidential hopeful declared he would seek the death penalty for drug and human traffickers, if elected

Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump would send US military assets to fight the drug cartels south of the Mexican border, he claimed in a campaign video seen by Fox News on Thursday.

Trump outlined a plan to deploy US forces to “inflict maximum damage” on the criminal networks, adding that he would impose a naval embargo on the cartels while securing the “full cooperation” of neighboring governments to “dismantle” regional drug- and people-smuggling networks.

The former president promised to lean on Congress to adopt the death penalty for drug dealers and human traffickers, while pushing federal authorities to target gangs and organized crime groups responsible for the street-level drug trade.

Fentanyl would be permanently listed as a federal controlled substance under a second Trump presidency, he continued, warning that China would “pay a steep price” if it failed to “clamp down” on selling the chemical precursors used to make the drug. He claimed he had had “a deal worked out with President Xi” in which “they weren’t going to be sending any more, and they were going to impose the death penalty on those that made it in China.”

“When I am back in the White House, I will take action on day one to end this horrific plague and save American lives,” Trump declared in the video, contrasting his achievements to those of Democratic rival Joe Biden, whom he claimed had walked away from the deal he made with Beijing as well as his accomplishments with regard to the border. 

“Under Joe Biden, our hard-won progress has been surrendered, along with the surrender of our southern border,” the Republican candidate lamented, blaming the incumbent for “fentanyl and other ultra-deadly poisons… stealing more than 100,000 American lives every single year.”

In addition to punishing dealers, Trump has proposed increasing federal funding for “faith-based” counseling and rehab programs for drug addicts, and suggested family members of addicts should be able to take leave from work in order to care for their loved ones. 

Trump is far from the only member of his party to suggest sending the US military to fight drug cartels, an idea Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador (AMLO) has staunchly opposed as a violation of Mexican sovereignty. 

Fentanyl seizures at the US southern border more than tripled between 2020 and 2022, and 2023’s numbers have already outstripped last year’s with six months left on the calendar. The number of fentanyl overdose deaths has jumped 94% since 2019, and it remains the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18 to 45.

### Voting for Erdogan ‘a sin’ – election rival
Kemal Kilicdaroglu called on Turkish Muslims to withhold their votes from the incumbent president

urkish presidential candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu has declared it “a sin” to vote for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, adding that “sincere Muslims” would not commit such an act. Erdogan, a social conservative, is expected to defeat Kilicdaroglu in a runoff election on Sunday.

“Do not sin by voting for Erdogan,” Kilicdaroglu urged the faithful during an appearance on Fox News’ Turkish subsidiary on Saturday. “A sincere Muslim would not commit such a great sin,” he added.

Kilicdaroglu’s invocation of religion is out of character for the secularist politician. His CHP party supported a ban on the wearing of headscarves in public institutions until last year, and Kilicdaroglu himself follows a minority sect of Shia Islam – Alevism – rather than the mainstream Sunni Islam that around 90% of Türkiye’s population follow.

Erdogan, by contrast, is an Islamist, and won the support of religious conservatives when he repealed separate headscarf bans in universities and government agencies from 2013 onwards. In the runup to this month’s elections, Erdogan portrayed himself as a defender of traditional Islamic values against the more liberal Kilicdaroglu, whom he described as “an LGBT person” at a rally three weeks ago.

Some 50 Muslim scholars have endorsed Erdogan’s reelection campaign, writing in a statement that his policies “have improved personal freedoms, eliminated hijab limitations, facilitated mosque construction, and encouraged the memorization of the Koran.”

Erdogan defeated Kilicdaroglu in the first round of the Turkish presidential election on May 14, winning 49.5% of the vote to Kilicdaroglu’s 44.9%. However, with neither candidate securing more than 50%, a second round of voting will take place on Sunday following the elimination of third candidate Sinan Ogan, who secured just over 5% in the first round.

Ogan has since endorsed Erdogan, and the incumbent is predicted to win by between two and four points, according to recent opinion polls.

### Saudi Arabia buying up millions of barrels of Russian diesel – data
Meanwhile, supplies of the fuel from Riyadh are being sent to the EU

Saudi Arabia imported 174,000 barrels of diesel and gasoil a day from Russia in April, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing data from analytics firm Kpler.

Thу figure comes in contrast to 137,700 barrels per day recorded in the previous month. Imports kept rising in May, and amounted to 191,200 barrels a day in the first two weeks of the month alone, marking a record high since 2017.

At the same time, the Middle East nation emerged as the European Union’s number one supplier, leapfrogging Russia since February. The kingdom, however, is reportedly not reselling the diesel and gasoil that it receives from Russia, as such a move would be considered a breach of sanctions imposed by the bloc on Moscow over its military operation in Ukraine.   

According to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Bloomberg, the latest upsurge in production at the kingdom’s refineries was responsible for the increase in imports to the EU.

The unnamed sources also told the news agency that additional exported fuels, which came from different parts of the country, were made to different specifications and were often subject to long-term supply commitments.

The data tracked by Kpler also shows that Saudi Arabia outpaced the US to become the world’s second-biggest exporter of diesel and gasoil last month. Nearly 35% of the kingdom’s overall April exports were reportedly shipped to EU member states and the UK. Meanwhile, sanctions-hit Russia remains the number one seller of the fuel.

### Closer relations with Taipei instead of Beijing are against the EU’s interests
Taiwan’s top ‘diplomat’s’ controversial Euro Trip could overstep China’s red line

Taiwan’s so-called “Foreign Minister” Joseph Wu spoke at the 2023 European Values Summit in Prague earlier this month, saying that the island, which is internationally recognized as part of China, wants to maintain the current status quo and secure peace and stability. To accomplish this, Wu explained that Taiwan would require help from European countries.

“In order for Taiwan to stay strong and resilient and to have the courage to continue the policy of maintaining the status quo, we do need support from European friends,” Wu said during the summit in Prague after Czech President Petr Pavel delivered opening remarks. The not officially-recognized diplomat then went on to visit Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union, where he spoke to members of the European Parliament, including its Vice President Nicola Beer.

What is principally ironic about Wu’s entire appearance is that this itself violates the agreed-upon status quo that any country that establishes bilateral relations with China must necessarily accept, namely some interpretation of the One China policy. To have diplomatic relations with China, a country cannot formally recognize Taiwan as a separate entity or, as its official name, the Republic of China, would suggest, as the legitimate government of China. For the Czech President to host Taiwan’s “foreign minister” and speak directly before him is about as formal as recognition goes. 

Is it really in the interest of the EU or the Czech Republic to torch relations with China just to pursue an idealistic partnership with Taiwan? Of course it isn’t. In fact, the potential pay-off of a partnership with Taiwan has been massively overhyped and the Central and Eastern European region has been one of the premier battlegrounds for Beijing vs. Taipei in the international scene for some time.

This was best demonstrated through the formation and subsequent dissolution of the 16+1 format aimed at encouraging cooperation between China, countries on the EU’s eastern flank, and the Western Balkans. The countries which have benefited most from this format and shored up huge investments from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are primarily not EU members and do not have civil societies that are overwhelmingly anti-communist, nationalistic and reactionary.

Serbia, for instance, saw the construction of a “friendship bridge” over the Danube River, which was opened in 2014. In 2021, Belgrade signed a contract for new wastewater treatment plants across 65 municipalities and, in 2022, penned further deals for another bridge and a brand-new highway.

Montenegro has an ongoing project with China to build a highway linking its main port to its interior and to neighboring Serbia, which has drawn widespread criticism from the EU over debt concerns. Undeterred, the small country signed another deal this year for a second highway along the coast.

By contrast, Hungary, which has tried to engage positively with Beijing, saw the EU string up investment opportunities. The EU once took aim at the legality of the tender process for the Hungarian section of a high-speed railway line between Belgrade and Budapest. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic under former president Milos Zeman was promised some 60 billion Czech crowns ($2.73 billion) in investment projects from China but most of these never materialized and journalists started criticizing the proposals as hollow. It is hard to say what happened in each and every case of investment, but negative perceptions of China likely played a significant role.

Through the course of 2021 and 2022, the format shrank to 13+1 after Lithuania, Estonia and finally Latvia withdrew from the cooperation platform. All three countries are among the most radically anti-communist and heavily influenced by the US, which likely played a major role in their inability to amicably negotiate business deals with their Chinese counterparts with their overlords in Washington breathing down their neck.

Having lived in the Czech capital for four years, I can say that the civil society here is intensely influenced by the US. The American propaganda outlet Radio Free Europe is headquartered in Prague, the largest TV station in the country (Prima News) was purchased by CNN, and the English language is becoming ubiquitous. Even one of the largest lobbying organizations in the country – the one where President Pavel and “Foreign Minister” Wu spoke – is nearly 37% funded by US government agencies, such as the State Department and USAID.

The goal of the US is clear: It wants its immature, new European republic proxies to spit in China’s face to the point where they aren’t even expected to follow official US policy, namely the One China policy. They’re supposed to actually up the ante by essentially recognizing Taiwan as independent, getting a proper diplomatic whipping from Beijing, crying to Washington and then being “saved” by it. This is an extremely typical chain of events that seemingly repeats without end, with the Czech Republic and Baltic States playing the part of the eternal victim.

The thing is this situation is only good for a tiny swath of elites in these countries. It helps them maintain their positions of power by gaining the praise of the pro-US and US-owned media. However, splintering relations with China, the largest trading partner of the European Union, and seeking to replace it with deeper cooperation with the tiny island of Taiwan is a ridiculous strategy. It goes without saying that Taiwan, which has an economy 4% the size of mainland China’s (by nominal GDP), does not have anywhere near the same potential.

### Saudi Crown Prince threatened to damage US economy – media
Mohammed bin Salman privately pledged to retaliate in a row over oil production cuts, leaked documents reportedly show

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman privately threatened to harm the American economy after President Joe Biden warned Saudi Arabia of “consequences” for agreeing an oil production cut with Russia, the Washington Post has reported, citing leaked material.

The Biden administration had said it would re-evaluate relations with the kingdom following a decision by Riyadh to slash crude production against the wishes of the US.

The Crown Prince, who is widely referred to as MBS, warned that he would not deal with the US administration anymore if Biden penalized Saudi Arabia. He also promised “major economic consequences for Washington,” the Post reported on Thursday.

The threat was contained in a classified document that was leaked on a Discord server, but it was not clear whether the remark was part of intercepted communications or a message sent privately to the US.

Biden made his dissatisfaction with Riyadh clear last October after the OPEC+ group of major oil producers including Russia agreed to cut production by two million barrels a day. Washington was working to punish Moscow with sanctions on its oil trade over the conflict in Ukraine.

“There’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done with Russia,” the US president said in an interview with CNN at the time, without specifying any possible measures.

On the campaign trail before his election, Biden vowed to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over the Crown Prince’s alleged role in the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, which Riyadh blamed on rogue agents.

This threat never materialized, with White House insiders indicating that the Biden administration had opted against jeopardizing bilateral relations. Under a decades-old arrangement, the US provides security to Saudi Arabia, and in exchange retains access to its oil, which the kingdom trades for dollars, propping it up as a global currency.

A number of top US officials recently traveled to Saudi Arabia, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken. These relations contrast with the reportedly poor personal chemistry between Biden and MBS, who have not met since last July.

The 37-year-old Saudi Crown Prince, who is responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom in lieu of his father, King Salman, reportedly mocks Biden in private, making fun of his gaffes and mental lapses. Critics of the US president have accused him of caving in to Saudi pressure.
